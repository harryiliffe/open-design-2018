Form development began with some simple sketches and brainstorming of form ideas and concepts surrounding that. We wanted to insure we kept in mind our key words from our word map above.

We began with an initial idea of a simple felt wrap bracelet but felt limited by the size. The form was also being heavily lead by the electronics and we wanted them to work in harmony rather then force issues upon each other.
