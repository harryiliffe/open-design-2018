Form development began with some simple sketches and brainstorming of form ideas and concepts surrounding that. We wanted to insure we kept in mind our key words from our word map above.

We began with an initial idea of a simple felt wrap bracelet but felt limited by the size. The form was also being heavily lead by the electronics and we wanted them to work in harmony rather then force issues upon each other. We loved the felt material 100% wool property was breathable and comfortable on the skin.

The natural evolution from the previous steps was to begin creating some more thought-out sketches which explored form in a more fluid and fun way.

The second concept really appealed as the combination of felt and a potential 3D printed part really spoke to us, we enjoyed the combination of old traditional materials with the ew high-tech techniques (this theme continues through-out)

We loved the combination of the felt body and the 3D printed shell, though we found him to geometric and lacked the fun tactile feel we were going for.

After choosing felt colours (you can see the process on our aesthetic development) We went ahead and powered on to creating the final product.
