Below are a few of our better conceptual ideas.
We like 1 (Creativity tracker), 3 (Dancing/Movement tracker) and 5 (LED wearable game) best

We also love the idea of using a snap bracelet as the housing for the project as it is playful, fun and easy to use.

1. Creativity movement tracker:
Tracking a pen to encourage lots of drawing

2. Chore Tracker:

3. Dancing/Movement tracker:
To visuals movement in 3d space and offer feedback
Could be really cool to integrate into google Tilt Brush

4. Electronic note type thing:
not sure a broad idea but could be cool to play around with.

5. LED wearable game
