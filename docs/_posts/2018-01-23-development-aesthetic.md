Below is a moodboard we created to aid us in our thinking about the aesthetic for our companion application.

Because the audience for our project is children we wanted to create an app aesthetic that reflected this. As you can see the look and feel was moulded around playfulness and joy. This is particularly seen in the colours that we were drawn to. We found the slightly muted rainbow of tones to be the most successful...

For our wearable itself we chose the colours yellow and grey for the same reasoning as above. The yellow acting as a bold and fun focal point, while the grey worked in a supporting role and ensured the colouring didn't become too full on. This was tied together with a white PLA shell. The white will allow the LED's and the yellow fins to take centre stage.
