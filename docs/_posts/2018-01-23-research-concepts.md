Here is 2 mindmaps on concepts that we could complete for our final project. The first is ideas to do with 'wearables' while the second is in relation to the concept of 'traces'

Below are a few of our better conceptual ideas explained further.
We like 1 (Creativity tracker), 3 (Dancing/Movement tracker) and 5 (LED wearable game) best

We also love the idea of using a snap bracelet as the housing for the project as it is playful, fun and easy to use.

3. Dancing/Movement tracker:
To visuals movement in 3d space and offer feedback
Could be really cool to integrate into google Tilt Brush
