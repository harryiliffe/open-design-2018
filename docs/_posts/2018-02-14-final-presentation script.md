To orchestrate our project today we’ve used the the aesthetic of our actual circuit board and fashioned it into our presentation homepage.

Slide 1: Precedents - Wearables

We started off looking at our subject matter of wearables are were immediately drawn to the sheer variety of ideas that were already in existence. As a group we found quickly that we all seemed to like projects that incorporated playfulness, movement or interactivity in addition to a sense of usefulness. A couple of stand outs were the LED Dress that was unveiled at New York Fashion Week in 2016. Though the dress was designed by Zac Posen, the LED displays were coded by technologist Maddy Maxey and incorporated animations designed by girls from around the world. With fewer than 1 percent of high school girls in the US planning to study computer science in college, in collaboration with Google's Made with Code initiative this project encouraged girls to design a "little black dress" for the digital age. 

The other image at the bottom is the 9mm wide and less that 2mm thick UV Sense launched by beauty company L’Oreal. Able to be worn on a fingernail, a watch, or even a pair of sunglasses, it’s UV sensor tracks how much UV exposure you're getting. The accompanying study saw that 30% of user were applying more sunscreen and 60% were having less sunburn.

Slide 2: Precedent - Motion Capture
In addition to those 2, one particular project we took a lot of inspiration from was “Traces.” Designed by Lesia Trubat, traces combines the Lilypad Arduino technology with ballet shoes. The idea is that as a dancer moves, the pressure and motion created with their feet is captured and transformed into a visual snapshot that can be viewed later within a companion application for a unique analysis. Dancers can view and interpret their own movements and from there, even compare them with the movements of other dancers.

Slide 3: Research - Interactiveness
As briefly touched upon earlier, a key component that we found crucial when manufacturing our own concept ideas, was the need for interaction. Interaction design focuses on marrying engaging ideas with well thought out behaviors. Though we identified that interactions can be created at multiple points we decided that we wanted to focus on nailing 2 in particular, that with the wearable item and also the interaction between our user and the people around them. This can be seen in the examples above. The one on the left is a wearable pet that is responsive to the users touch and emotions, while the second is a wearable game that you play with friends.

Slide 4: Research - Audience
Additionally, because our wearable will ultimately be a product we examined qualities that alter the way users feel about a product, brand, business or service.These include its appropriateness - both in its context and tone, its relevance and whether it meets users needs, is it meaningful - does it ultimately have a purpose and lastly, is it endearing - do users find it desirable. From this we created a user journey of those engaging with our product. (add more)
With the sheer amount of competing products  - now more than ever we aren’t just passively consuming information and ideas as once experienced, we crave products that hold our interest and even ones that we can learn from.

Slide 5: Analysis - The Shift
Past generations have seen a distinct lack in what we know as DIY. Most of this learning came from an individual’s parents which became difficult when both become busy working full-time which become the norm. Even in schools the domestic and creative arts education such as home economics or wood-working over time reduced to an optional course or not offered even at all. In essence, the very word “making” or the act of being a “maker” or “DIYer” has rapidly changed. However, it is still changing, today affecting more people than ever before. This is because our generation has seen a shift with so many people now able to freely share ideas and spread inspiration across the web. We’re seeing makers forming communities, and more people around the world are becoming influenced to be makers themselves. There is a thirst for learning and fashioning one’s own ideas. We want to capitalise on this by empowering the youth of today with a tool that fuels making and collaboration.  

Slide 6: The Big Idea
Enter Greg! Greg is a multi-dimensional companion that draws on the tinkerer in all of us. Greg is worn on the users arm and offers a number of different outputs that we will explore in the next few slides. Again, we thought about interactivity a lot because we knew that an understanding of how users and technology could communicate with each may lead to a really beneficial project. As a result we have created a number of different touchpoints or places of interaction. Internally users can interact with both the wearable itself and also with the code to manufacture their own unique greg while externally this piece also provides interaction with other wearers and also a companion app that we have additionally materialised within this project.

Slide 9: The Solution - Features and Benefits
Now that greg had an interface and shell we next wanted to add some key features that offered strong benefits and were also fun for the wearer to engage with.The first is a motion tracker that we drew inspiration for from the ballet shoes example, it works as a recording device that then also produces a visual image output. Other potential pathways for this feature includes tracking fitness levels and even gesture control. The next feature we’ve included in greg is capacitive touch. This acts as a source of input through physical interaction with greg by tapping, swiping and pinching. The third key feature is the addition of beeping aids users by providing feedback of their interactions with greg. Lastly we have incorporated an idle mode. While predominantly functioning as a power save mode, it also reflects gregs emotive state. Stroking incurs purring and passively changes lights accordingly while severe shaking incurs growling and sporadic red lights.

Slide 10: The Solution - Companion App
One crucial element we thought was necessary in terms of a management tool was to create a companion app. The app is mainly a source for personal modification and personalisation of each user’s own greg. The main screen lists all the modes available and when clicked on offers a description of each, as well as the option to toggle whether or not you want sound. For motion tracking, it is also where users can view the visualisations they’ve created in this space. We also designed it to be colourful and enjoyable to reflect the nature of the wearable itself thereby interconnecting the 2 pieces.

Slide 11: Summary - Wider Benefits
From a wellbeing perspective, and as a source of companionship, greg could also be used to reduce anxiety and discomfort for its wearer. At this grassroots level we additionally see greg as a portal for greater learning and connectivity which is especially important when designing for youth. Not only is greg co-creative but he is also very much user-centred where his potential within the open source community is limitless. Together, our users will push each other forward to invent and build new and innovative things for greg.
