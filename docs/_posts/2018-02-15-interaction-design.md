Interaction design focuses on creating engaging interfaces with well thought out behaviours. Understanding how users and technology communicate with each other is fundamental to this field. With this understanding, you can anticipate how someone might interact with the system, fix problems early, as well as invent new ways of doing things.

We also identified steps to creating and understanding interactions...

Define How Users Can Interact with the Interface
What can a user do with their mouse, finger, or stylus to directly interact with the interface? This helps us define the possible user interactions with the product.

Anticipate and Mitigate Errors
Do error messages provide a way for the user to correct the problem or explain why the error occurred? This lets us anticipate and mitigate errors.

Consider System Feedback and Response Time
What feedback does a user get once an action is performed? This allows us to ensure that the system provides feedback in a reasonable time after user actions.

Strategically Think about Each Elements
Are the interface elements a reasonable size to interact with? Questions like this helps us think strategically about each element used in the product.

Simplify for Learnability
Are familiar or standard formats used? Standard elements and formats are used to simplify and enhance the learnability of a product
