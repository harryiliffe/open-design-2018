The roughly mocked-up wireframes below were used to structure our information in a clear and concise way. It allowed us to identify 2 possible journeys of moving through the application. After discussion, we decided that the journey on the left of the page identified a more systematic journey than the other. From user testing it also served as the clearest process for them to operate through. Despite this feedback we did recognise that the alternative journey offered some great points that we could also incorporate into our final output with some tweaking.
