This section will guide you through assembling the Housing for the Electronics.
### Step 1: Aquire Materials

You will need a few main materials to complete the housing we designed for Greg or feel free to design your own!

1. Wool Felt

This is for the body of Greg and the wrist strap

2. Embroidery thread

To keep Greg together (emotionally and physically)

3. PLA plastic

This is to 3D Print his shell. In any colour (you could try flexible or glow in the dark filament for something funky)

4. Conductive thread

 This is used to link Gregs' fins and legs to the capacitive touch sensor.

5. Velcro, or your preferred fastening

To keep Greg on you

6. Magnets 6mm by 1mm

This is to keep the shell on

### Step 2: Machinery

1. Laser cutter

To cut out the wool felt.

2. 3D Printer

To print out his shell.

### Step 3: Files

Download the laser files from ![here](https://github.com/harryiliffe/open-design-2018/tree/master/form) And download the Fusion 360 Files ![here](http://a360.co/2HkOeeE) for the top and ![here](http://a360.co/2swG67p) for the base.
Or get crazy and create your own.

### Step 4: Assemble

Assembly is pretty straight forward, we assembled Greg in the following order

1. Sew capacitive touch points with conductive thread and wire. Here is a wonderfully helpful link [Eleanor's soft circuits](https://fablabwgtn.github.io/Winterns2017/SS_techniques)

2. Sew Gregs' body onto the felt band through the handy holes provided.

3. Sew on the base of the shell

4. Adhere Magnets

5. Sew in Gregs' intestines, brain and heart

6. Enjoy your lovely wonderful Greg :)
