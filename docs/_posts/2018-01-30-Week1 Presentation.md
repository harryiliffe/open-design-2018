The work of the modern designer resides mostly within the computer, where every move we make is both precise and effortless. Steve Jobs once famously likened the computer to a bicycle for the human mind. Computers let us jump straight to pixels—a space of precision where everything aligns to a grid, is boldly coloured and often fully formed. It’s in this space that we as creators find ourselves attached as more precise outputs are much harder to abandon. There is a danger when creative exploration starts with precision and it’s discovery instead we should crave. Cue the open source method, one that revolutionised the software industry, and created a flourishing social movement that is 1 -community-minded 2 - highly creative and 3- iterative in the sense that it continues to evolve. Short cycle designs that tended to exist for a mere few years in the marketplace can live on and develop into completely new shapes and uses.

Our first case study is Jay Silver. The reason we are telling you about Jay Silver is because he is an open designer who has done some pretty cool things. Let’s start with a story. In fourth grade, completely by accident Jay Silver discovered that his walkie-talkies communicated at the exact same frequency as his remote-control car. After this initial curiosity and discovery he began tinkering with not only the car, but also an upside-down trash can and a few other parts to make a robot that he could control by making sounds into his walkie-talkies. But his tinkering did not end there. Even years later this fascination of combining or refashioning objects remained and eventually drew him to MIT. Here he completed his Master’s in Media Technology and eventually his PhD in the World as a Construction Kit from the Lifelong Kindergarten.

The MIT Lifelong Kindergarten works to develops new technologies and activities that are designed, in the spirit of the blocks and finger painting, through a childlike sense of play and exploration. This goal of a world of playfully creative people--that is often lost in the transition through adulthood--has informed Silver's life and work ever since. One of his first creations was Drawdio, an electronic pencil that lets you make music as you draw. In his own words he describes these tools as being designed to help adults “see the world as malleable, so they see themselves as agents of change in their everyday lives.” As well as going on to found JoyLabz, Jay gives regular workshops on this philosophy. Although they are aimed mostly at children, he's been invited to speak at idea-driven conferences like TEDx,VMWorld and PopTech because his lessons are applicable to an audience far wider than this.

One of Jay’s biggest success stories is an invention kit that he developed with his classmate Eric Rosenbaum while still studying at MIT called MaKey MaKey. They put it up on Kickstarter, and hundreds of people bought it in the first day. They said the best thing about is was after it’s release they started getting a flood of videos in of people doing interesting things with it. Now we’ve got a wee video here to showcase how a selection of people have decided to used it. Towards the end on the video there is a snippet on MaKey MaKey Go which is an evolution of sorts.

as you can see, by simply using the control panel and a couple of alligator clips, users can turn everyday objects into touchpads --which they can then combine with the internet for a whole spectrum of further opportunities. Any material that can conduct at least a tiny bit of electricity will work. Now Makey Makey Go is a natural evolution to its predecessor. It catalyzes the same ingenuity but now it’s the size of a flash drive so its more accessible and versatile than ever. You see the girl on the screen has decided to use hers as an earring. Jay says the coolest thing about Makey Makey, which heavily aligns with his Kindergarten philosophy, is that its exploratory and its fun. Little did he realise however, is how useful and meaningful this product could actually be as well. Not only have educators used it to play games or teach kids about basic electrical circuitry, but one customer even wrote to him about his son who had cerebral palsy and therefore couldn’t use a normal keyboard. So this customer used MaKey MaKey, by combining it with a specific set of gloves that his son could now use to navigate the web. Now this is eye opening in terms of this completely new discussion around accessibility that MaKey MaKey brings with it.
