# Jay Silver
After studying at electrical engineering at Georgia Tech, where he was named engineer of the year, Silver went on to earn his Masters from MIT's media lab and his PhD MIT's media lab lifelong kindergarten.
Silver than invented an toy which time magazine which was named one of TIME Magazine’s “Top 15 Toys for Young Geniuses” in 2011. The open source toy, named [Drawdio], allowed the user to use a pencil, a stream of water, or anything conductive to create crazy theremin like sounds. Following on with the success of Drawdio, Silver went on to start a kickstarter for his next big project. Titled Makey Makey, this was also an open source toy claiming to be an inventive tool kit for everyone. Using a circuit board and cables connected to a an object of some sort (bananas, foil, again anything remotely conductive) it would send mouse or keypresses back to the computer. This allowed children of all ages to explore and interact with a physical-digital interface in a brand new way.
